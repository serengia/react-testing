# Testing in React

In this project, I focus on testing in react. When you build react project using `npx create-react-app`, the testing environment is already set up for you. `Jest` testing runner and related react assertin library are set up for you.

In this repo, you will find examples of implementation of react `unit testing`, `integration testing` and `end-to-end` testing. I also go into testing `Async` functions and also `mocking`. I even go into demostrating how to incoporate `state` in testing and tests for different things when `some action` such as `click event` occurs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
